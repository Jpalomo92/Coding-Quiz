# Coding Quiz

## Description

In this project, I created a quiz that will test a users basic knowledge on coding. 

This quiz presents one question at a time for the user to answer all while being timed. If the user answers incorrectly the time is reduced by ten seconds. If the user is able to complete the quiz within the allotted time, then the user is given their score.

The goal is writing code in Javascript to run a function that would randomize the listed questions and answers, while keeping track of the time, and if the answers provided are correct or not. 

The biggest challenge was getting the functions to work properly. It took a lot of reading through documentation, and going through our previous activities for reference. There was plenty of debugging needed when it came to the timer and getting it to stop once it hit zero. Im still hitting a minor bug where I cannot get the feedback to say 'Correct' or 'Wrong' once the user answers a question. 

Something that I've learned from this challenge is learning how to keep track of my code. I caught myself getting frustrated with the functions and forgetting which one did which.
